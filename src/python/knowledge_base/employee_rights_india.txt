TITLE: OVERVIEW OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS IN INDIA

--- SECTION: RIGHT TO TIMELY SALARY ---
The Payment of Wages Act, 1936, mandates that employees receive their wages on time. For companies with less than 1,000 employees, salary must be paid by the 7th day of the month. For others, it must be paid by the 10th day. The Act also specifies that employers cannot make unauthorized deductions from an employee's salary. Deductions for fines, absence from duty, or damage to goods must follow a strict legal procedure.

--- SECTION: WORKING HOURS AND OVERTIME ---
The Factories Act, 1948, stipulates that an adult worker cannot be asked to work for more than 48 hours in a week and not more than 9 hours in a day. Any work done beyond these hours is considered overtime. An employee is entitled to receive overtime pay at twice the rate of their regular wages. State-specific Shops and Establishment Acts often have similar provisions for workers in other sectors.

--- SECTION: LEAVE AND HOLIDAYS ---
Employees are entitled to various types of leave, including casual leave, sick leave, and earned leave (privilege leave). The Maternity Benefit Act, 2017, provides female employees with 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for their first two children. There are also provisions for national holidays and festival holidays, which are mandatory paid leaves.

--- SECTION: SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT ---
Every employee has the right to a safe and secure working environment. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) mandates that every employer with more than 10 employees must set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to address complaints of sexual harassment. Employers are also responsible for providing basic safety measures to prevent workplace accidents.

--- SECTION: NOTICE PERIOD AND TERMINATION ---
An employer cannot terminate an employee arbitrarily. The employment contract, or 'appointment letter', must specify the notice period required from either side for termination. If the contract does not specify a notice period, a reasonable period, typically one month, is implied. In cases of layoff or retrenchment, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, provides for compensation to be paid to the worker.
