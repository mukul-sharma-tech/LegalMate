TITLE: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF TENANTS IN INDIA

--- SECTION: THE RENTAL AGREEMENT ---
A written rental agreement is the most crucial document for a tenant. It protects the rights of both the tenant and the landlord. The agreement should be registered, especially if the lease period is for more than 11 months. A tenant has the right to a copy of the written agreement. The agreement should clearly state the rent amount, duration of the tenancy, security deposit amount, and other terms and conditions.

--- SECTION: SECURITY DEPOSIT RULES ---
Landlords typically collect a security deposit at the start of the tenancy. The Model Tenancy Act, 2021, suggests a cap on the security deposit to a maximum of two months' rent. The landlord is required to refund the security deposit to the tenant within a month of the premises being vacated, after making any deductions for damages caused by the tenant beyond normal wear and tear.

--- SECTION: EVICTION PROCEDURES ---
A landlord cannot evict a tenant arbitrarily or without a valid reason. Valid reasons for eviction are specified in state-level rent control acts, and typically include non-payment of rent, misuse of the property, or the landlord needing the property for their own use. The landlord must provide a written notice to the tenant before filing an eviction suit in court. Forcibly evicting a tenant is illegal.

--- SECTION: BASIC AMENITIES AND REPAIRS ---
The tenant has a right to essential services such as an adequate supply of water and electricity. The landlord cannot cut off these services, even in case of a dispute. The landlord is generally responsible for major structural repairs and maintenance of the property, such as fixing leaks or structural cracks, to ensure it remains habitable. The tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs.

--- SECTION: RENT INCREASES AND PRIVACY ---
A landlord cannot increase the rent arbitrarily during the tenancy period unless specified in the rental agreement. Any rent increase must be mutually agreed upon or follow the terms laid out in the contract. Furthermore, a tenant has the right to privacy. The landlord cannot enter the rented premises whenever they wish and must provide reasonable notice to the tenant before a visit.
